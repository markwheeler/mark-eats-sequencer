# Mark Eats Sequencer
MIDI step sequencer for monome grids with a focus on jamming and performing with loops as soon as youâ€™ve made them.

I've not been actively working on this project for a while and do not have plans to return to it in the near future. If you would like to dig into the code and have questions please do reach out! :)
